                <h2>Section 1: The Original Webpage</h2>
                <p>The reason I chose this interface is because I wanted to get a haircut while at brown last semester, and I remembered how confusing and hard is was to navigate those web pages. One of the webpages I found was <a href="http://moss-hair-salon-providence.com/index.html">Moss Salon</a></p>

                <h4>Problems with the website:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The nav bar has “our staff” perpetually highlighted when it isn't actually the page we're on.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can't really look at the pictures that appear for a long time, the timing is weird, and the user doesn't have any control.</li>
                    <li>All the images don't look like something the salon did, making it less credible.
                    </li>
                    <li>The address of the place is too small, awkwardly positioned, and unnoticeable.
                    </li>
                    <li>It seems like their contacts on the bottom have not been updated in a while; they still have google+ there.
                    </li>
                    <li>The information given in the paragraphs at the bottom of the page could be designated to other pages, rather than cluttering the main page.
                    </li>
                    <li>On a mobile screen, the nav bar is cluttered. All of the elements gather around one corner.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Accessibility issues with webpage:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The color contrast is horrible. For example, its is very hard to read the navbar, and the logo on the header.
                    </li>
                    <li>The alt text is not descriptive. The description of one of the images is, “Providence Hair Styling”.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
            
                <div class="section" class="flex-item">
                    <h2>Section 2: Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
                    <p>In order to start addressing the problems from section one, I created low fidelity prototypes. It was important to me to address all the necessary usability issues in one go.</p>

                <div class="section" class="flex-item">
                    <h2> Section 3: Visual Design Style Guide</h2>
                    <p>Before creating a High Fidelity prototype, I created a visual design style guide to get me started. I created it with the intent to have good color contrast, while also having a consistent aesthetic. I also wanted it to fit in with the word 'moss'.</p>

                <div class="section"class="flex-item">
                <h2>Section 4: High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
                    <p>Using the visual design style guide and the lo-fi protoyple, I created a high fidelity prototype. It is annotated with CSS style tips and suggestions for a developer.</p>

                    <p>Using all the elements above, a responsive webpage was created. You can check it out here: <a href="https://hungrylizard586.github.io/responsiveProject/"><strong>New Moss Salon Page</strong></a>. Additionally, here are some screenshots from different devices:</p>
